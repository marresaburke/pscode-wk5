// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Input number 
IF number ends in 1 
	print odd 
IF number ends in 2
	print even
IF number ends in 3
	print odd 
IF number ends if 4
	print even
IF number ends in 5
	print odd 
IF number ends in 6
	print even
IF number ends in 7
	print odd 
If number ends in 8
	print even
IF number ends in 9 
	print odd 
IF number ends in 0
	print even


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


Ask for 5 different numbers 
Add all the number together
Print SUM 
Take the SUM divide by 5 
Print AVG 
{num1+ num2+ num3+ num4+ num5= SUM 
	print SUM 
Take SUM divide by 5 = AVG 
	print AVG}

Set List num1+ num2+ num3+ num4+ num5

IF num1 > MAX THEN  
	MAX = num1
ENDIF 
IF num1 < MIN THEN 
	MIN = num1
ENDIF 
NEXT number in list 
Repeat 5x 
	print MAX
	print MIN
